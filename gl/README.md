# gl (grocery list)

This is personal software. I have never found a grocery list solution that has the 3 key features I want:

[] autocomplete from previous entries
[] sharing/multiplayer with members of my household
[] categorization to sort by the order I move through the grocery store

`gl` aims to accomplish these three things.
